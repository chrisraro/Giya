# Giya App - Post-Deployment Steps

Now that you've successfully pushed your changes to GitHub, here's what happens next and what you should do to monitor and verify the deployment.

## What's Happening Now

1. **Vercel Deployment**: 
   - Your push to GitHub automatically triggered a new deployment on Vercel
   - Vercel is now building your application with the latest changes
   - This process typically takes 2-5 minutes

2. **Build Process**:
   - Vercel will run `pnpm build` to compile your Next.js application
   - All dependencies will be installed
   - The build output will be deployed to your production environment

## How to Monitor the Deployment

1. **Visit Your Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Find your Giya project
   - Click on it to view deployment details

2. **Check Deployment Status**:
   - The latest deployment will show at the top
   - Status indicators:
     - üîµ In Progress: Build is running
     - ‚úÖ Completed: Deployment successful
     - ‚ùå Error: Something went wrong

3. **View Build Logs**:
   - Click on the deployment to see detailed logs
   - Watch for any errors during the build process
   - Successful builds will show "Ready!" at the end

## Database Updates (Important!)

Before testing the application, you need to run the database schema updates:

1. **Run Script 008**:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Open [scripts/008_fix_redemptions_schema.sql](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/scripts/008_fix_redemptions_schema.sql)
   - Copy and paste the contents into the SQL editor
   - Run the script

This script will:
- Unify the redemption tables
- Update the point deduction mechanism
- Fix all the issues we identified

## Verification Steps

Once the Vercel deployment is complete and you've run the database updates:

1. **Visit Your Live Site**:
   - Go to your deployed URL (shown in Vercel dashboard)
   - Test the application as different user types

2. **Test Reward Redemption Flow**:
   - Log in as a customer
   - Navigate to Rewards page
   - Redeem a reward and verify:
     - Points are deducted correctly
     - QR code is generated
     - Redemption appears in history

3. **Test QR Code Scanning**:
   - Log in as a business
   - Navigate to Validate Redemption page
   - Scan a customer's redemption QR code
   - Verify you can validate the redemption

4. **Check Point Accuracy**:
   - Verify customer points display correctly
   - Ensure point deductions are accurate

## Common Issues and Solutions

### If the Build Fails:
1. Check the build logs for specific error messages
2. Common issues:
   - Missing environment variables
   - TypeScript/JavaScript errors
   - Dependency issues

### If the Application Doesn't Work After Deployment:
1. Ensure you ran the database script [008_fix_redemptions_schema.sql](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/scripts/008_fix_redemptions_schema.sql)
2. Check that environment variables are set in Vercel:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### If QR Code Scanning Doesn't Work:
1. Verify the business is scanning the correct QR code
2. Check that the redemption record exists in the database
3. Ensure the business is associated with the correct business_id

## Expected Improvements

After successful deployment and database updates, you should see:

‚úÖ **Reward Redemption**: Customers can redeem rewards with immediate point deductions
‚úÖ **QR Code Scanning**: Businesses can scan and validate customer redemptions
‚úÖ **Point Accuracy**: Customer points display correctly and update properly
‚úÖ **Redemption History**: Both customers and businesses see accurate redemption history
‚úÖ **Seamless Flow**: The entire redemption process works from start to finish

## Support

If you encounter any issues after deployment:

1. Check the [TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md) for common solutions
2. Review the [VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md) for testing procedures
3. Refer to [PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md) for system architecture

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the Vercel deployment
2. Run the database schema updates
3. Test all functionality
4. Share the updated app with your users
