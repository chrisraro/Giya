# Business Dashboard QR Code Fixes

## Issue Identified

The business dashboard pages for both discount offers and exclusive offers were displaying QR codes directly in the offer cards. This violated the security requirement that QR codes should only be accessible through the "Redeem Now" button action in a modal dialog, not displayed publicly on business dashboards.

## Files Modified

### 1. Business Discount Offers Dashboard
**File**: `app/dashboard/business/discounts/page.tsx`
**Change**: Removed the QR code display section from the discount offer cards
**Lines Removed**: 
```jsx
{/* QR Code Section */}
{discount.qr_code_data && (
  <div className="pt-3 border-t">
    <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground mb-2">Scan this QR code to redeem offer:</p>
    <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
      <div className="border rounded p-2 bg-white">
        <QRCodeSVG value={discount.qr_code_data} size={80} level="H" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <p className="text-xs font-medium">Offer QR Code</p>
        <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Customers can scan this to redeem</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### 2. Business Exclusive Offers Dashboard
**File**: `app/dashboard/business/exclusive-offers/page.tsx`
**Change**: Removed the QR code display section from the exclusive offer cards
**Lines Removed**: 
```jsx
{/* QR Code Section */}
{offer.qr_code_data && (
  <div className="pt-3 border-t">
    <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground mb-2">Scan this QR code to redeem offer:</p>
    <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
      <div className="border rounded p-2 bg-white">
        <QRCodeSVG value={offer.qr_code_data} size={80} level="H" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <p className="text-xs font-medium">Offer QR Code</p>
        <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Customers can scan this to redeem</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

## Security Improvement

By removing the public display of QR codes from business dashboards, we ensure that:

1. QR codes are only accessible through the proper redemption flow
2. Customers must visit their dashboard and click "Redeem Now" to access QR codes
3. Businesses cannot accidentally expose QR codes to unauthorized users
4. The redemption process follows the intended security model

## Verification

To verify these fixes work correctly:

1. Visit the business dashboard discount offers page
   - Confirm that discount offer cards no longer display QR codes
   - Confirm that all other functionality remains intact

2. Visit the business dashboard exclusive offers page
   - Confirm that exclusive offer cards no longer display QR codes
   - Confirm that all other functionality remains intact

3. Visit the customer dashboard discount offers page
   - Confirm that clicking "Redeem Now" still properly displays QR codes in a modal dialog

4. Visit the customer dashboard exclusive offers page
   - Confirm that clicking "Redeem Now" still properly displays QR codes in a modal dialog

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Security**: QR codes are no longer publicly exposed on business dashboards
2. **Compliance**: Implementation now follows the specified security requirements
3. **User Experience**: Clear separation between business management and customer redemption flows
4. **Consistency**: Both discount and exclusive offers now follow the same security pattern
