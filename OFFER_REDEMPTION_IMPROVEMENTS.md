# Offer Redemption Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the discount and exclusive offers functionality in the Giya app to address user concerns about browsing, redeeming, and displaying offers.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Browsing and Redeeming Offers** - Made offers more visible and redeemable
2. **Display on Business Profile Page** - Added discount and exclusive offers sections to business profiles
3. **"Redeem Now" Buttons** - Changed "Visit Business" to "Redeem Now" on offer cards

## Changes Made

### 1. Customer Discount Offers Page (`app/dashboard/customer/discounts/page.tsx`)
- Changed "View Business" button to "Redeem Now"
- Button now shows a toast message instructing users to show their QR code

### 2. Customer Exclusive Offers Page (`app/dashboard/customer/exclusive-offers/page.tsx`)
- Changed "View Business" button to "Redeem Now"
- Button now shows a toast message instructing users to show their QR code

### 3. Business Profile Page (`app/business/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Added Discount Offers section to display available discount offers
- Added Exclusive Offers section to display available exclusive offers
- Fixed toast import to use "sonner" instead of incorrect path

## Implementation Details

### Button Changes
Instead of navigating to the business profile page, the "Redeem Now" buttons now:
1. Show a toast message instructing users to show their QR code
2. Direct users to use the QR code displayed on the offer card

### Business Profile Enhancements
Business profiles now display three sections:
1. Business information and rewards (existing)
2. Discount offers (new)
3. Exclusive offers (new)

Each section shows relevant offers with appropriate styling and information.
