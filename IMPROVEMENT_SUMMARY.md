- Created README.md for lib directory
- Documented props, usage, and examples for all major components

**Benefits**:
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Better maintainability
- Clear usage guidelines
- Reduced knowledge transfer overhead

## 10. Component Breakdown

**Task**: Break down large components into smaller, focused components

**Changes Made**:
- Created `CustomerStats`, `DiscoverBusinesses`, `QrCodeCard`, `QuickActions`, `BusinessPointsSection`, and `CustomerTransactionHistory` for customer dashboard
- Created `InfluencerStats`, `GenerateLinksTab`, `MyLinksTab`, and `ConversionsTab` for influencer dashboard
- Created `BusinessStats`, `QrScannerSection`, and `TransactionHistory` for business dashboard
- Refactored dashboard pages to use smaller components

**Benefits**:
