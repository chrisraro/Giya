# Final Implementation Summary: QR Code Centralization and Offer Management

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive summary of all the implementations completed for the Giya app, including Row Level Security policies for new tables and QR code centralization for discount and exclusive offers.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS) for New Tables
- **Tables**: `discount_offers`, `discount_usage`, `exclusive_offers`, `exclusive_offer_usage`
- **Policies**: Comprehensive access controls for businesses, customers, and system
- **Files**: 
  - `scripts/029_enable_rls_for_discount_and_exclusive_offers.sql`
  - `scripts/030_create_rls_verification_functions.sql`
  - `RLS_POLICIES_FOR_NEW_TABLES.md`
  - `RLS_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`
  - `FINAL_RLS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

### 2. QR Code Centralization
- **Centralized Scanner**: Single QR scanner in business dashboard handles all QR code types
- **Removed Pages**: Eliminated separate Validate Redemptions page
- **QR Generation**: Automatic QR code generation for discount and exclusive offers
- **Files**:
  - `scripts/031_add_qr_code_columns_to_offers.sql`
  - `scripts/032_create_offer_redemption_functions.sql`
  - Updated business dashboard (`app/dashboard/business/page.tsx`)
  - Updated navigation (`components/dashboard-nav.tsx`)
  - Updated offer management pages
  - `QR_CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

## Key Improvements

### Security

## Deployment Ready

All implementations are complete and ready for deployment:

1. **Database Scripts** (run in order):
   - `029_enable_rls_for_discount_and_exclusive_offers.sql`
   - `030_create_rls_verification_functions.sql`
   - `031_add_qr_code_columns_to_offers.sql`
   - `032_create_offer_redemption_functions.sql`

2. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Business dashboard with centralized QR scanning
   - Discount and exclusive offers management pages
