# QR Scanner Issues Analysis

## Current Implementation Issues

1. **Camera Access Permissions**: The QR scanner may fail if the browser doesn't have camera permissions
2. **Environment Camera**: The scanner tries to use the environment camera, which may not be available on all devices
3. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling for different failure scenarios
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Some browsers may have restrictions on camera access

## Proposed Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Add more specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Provide fallback options when camera access fails

### 2. Camera Selection Fallback
- Try environment camera first, then user camera, then any available camera
- Handle cases where no camera is available

### 3. Improved User Guidance
- Add clearer instructions for positioning QR codes
- Provide visual feedback when scanning is active

### 4. Manual Input Enhancement
- Improve the manual input flow
- Add validation for manually entered codes

## Implementation Plan

1. Update the QR scanner component with better error handling
2. Add fallback camera selection logic
3. Enhance user guidance and feedback
4. Test on multiple devices and browsers
