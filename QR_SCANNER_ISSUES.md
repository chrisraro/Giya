# QR Scanner Issues and Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. Scanning Performance Issues
- QR scanner keeps scanning mode without detecting codes properly
- jsQR library was unreliable for real-time scanning

### 2. Manual Code Validation Issues
- Manual code entry returns "invalid code or code expires" even with valid codes
- Poor error handling and feedback

### 3. Library Reliability
- jsQR library had limitations in real-world conditions

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Library Replacement
- **Before**: Using `jsqr` library
- **After**: Replaced with `html5-qrcode` library for better reliability

### 2. Improved Validation Logic
- Added whitespace trimming for manual code entry
- Enhanced error handling with specific error messages
- Better debugging information

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- Better visual feedback during scanning
- More helpful error messages
- Improved camera initialization

## Files Modified

1. **[components/qr-scanner.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/components/qr-scanner.tsx)** - Complete rewrite using html5-qrcode
2. **[app/dashboard/business/validate-redemption/page.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/app/dashboard/business/validate-redemption/page.tsx)** - Improved validation logic
3. **[app/dashboard/business/test-qr-scanner/page.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/app/dashboard/business/test-qr-scanner/page.tsx)** - New test page for debugging
4. **[QR_SCANNER_DEBUG_GUIDE.md](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/QR_SCANNER_DEBUG_GUIDE.md)** - Comprehensive debugging guide

## Testing

### New Test Page
Navigate to `/dashboard/business/test-qr-scanner` to test:
- QR scanning functionality
- Manual code entry validation
- Detailed error reporting

### Validation Improvements
- Whitespace trimming prevents issues with copied codes
- Specific error messages help identify problems
- Better logging for debugging

## QR Code Format
All redemption QR codes follow the format:
```
GIYA-REDEEM-{timestamp}-{random_string}
```

Example:
```
GIYA-REDEEM-1760031873060-qp3yno80g
```

## Common Issues Resolved

### 1. Continuous Scanning Without Detection
- **Cause**: jsQR library limitations
- **Fix**: html5-qrcode provides better real-time scanning

### 2. "Invalid Code" Errors
- **Cause**: Whitespace in manually entered codes
- **Fix**: Automatic trimming and better error messages

### 3. Camera Access Issues
- **Cause**: Inconsistent camera initialization
- **Fix**: Improved camera handling with fallback options

## Verification Steps

1. Test QR scanning with actual redemption codes
2. Test manual code entry with valid codes
3. Verify error handling with invalid codes
4. Check camera initialization on different devices
5. Test both front and rear cameras

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:
1. Revert to jsQR implementation
2. Restore original component
3. Check for dependency conflicts
4. Contact support with detailed logs

The new implementation should provide a much more reliable QR scanning experience.
