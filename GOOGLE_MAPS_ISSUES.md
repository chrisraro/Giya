# Google Maps Integration Issues Analysis

## Current Implementation Issues

1. **URL Processing**: The current implementation tries to convert a Google Maps URL to an embed URL by replacing "/maps/" with "/maps/embed/", which may not work for all Google Maps URLs
2. **CSP Issues**: Content Security Policy restrictions may prevent the iframe from loading
3. **Responsive Design**: The iframe may not be properly sized or responsive
4. **Error Handling**: No fallback if the Google Maps link is invalid or fails to load

## Proposed Fixes

### 1. Enhanced URL Processing
- Add better validation and conversion of Google Maps URLs
- Support different types of Google Maps URLs
- Provide fallback content if the map fails to load

### 2. Improved Responsive Design
- Ensure the iframe is properly sized and responsive
- Add loading states and error handling

### 3. Fallback Content
- Provide a static map image or address information as fallback
- Add error messages for failed map loading

## Implementation Plan

1. Update the Google Maps component with better URL processing
2. Add responsive design improvements
3. Implement fallback content for failed map loading
4. Test with different types of Google Maps URLs
