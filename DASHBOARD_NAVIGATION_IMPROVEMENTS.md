# Dashboard Navigation Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the navigation system across all dashboard pages in the Giya app. The goal was to ensure consistent access to profile settings across all user roles and improve the overall navigation experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Header Navigation Updates

All dashboard pages now include a settings link in the header for quick access to profile settings:

#### Business Dashboard
- **Location**: Header (top right)
- **Access**: Click the settings icon to access `/dashboard/business/settings`
- **Visibility**: Always visible in the header

#### Customer Dashboard
- **Location**: Header (top right)
- **Access**: Click the settings icon to access `/dashboard/customer/settings`
- **Visibility**: Always visible in the header

#### Influencer Dashboard
- **Location**: Header (top right)
- **Access**: Click the settings icon to access `/dashboard/influencer/settings`
- **Visibility**: Always visible in the header

### 2. Quick Actions Navigation

Each dashboard includes role-specific quick actions:

#### Business Dashboard
- Scan Customer QR Code
- Manage Rewards
- Profile Settings (moved to header only)

#### Customer Dashboard
- Show My QR Code
- View Rewards
- Profile Settings (moved to header only)

#### Influencer Dashboard
- Generate Affiliate Links

- Conversions
- Profile Settings (moved to header only)

### 3. Consistent UI Elements

All headers now follow the same pattern:
- User avatar and information on the left
- Settings icon and Logout button on the right
- Consistent styling and spacing

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure

Each dashboard page follows the same structure:

```tsx
<header className="border-b bg-background">
  <div className="container-padding-x container mx-auto flex items-center justify-between py-4">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
      {/* User avatar and info */}
    </div>
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <Link href="/dashboard/[role]/settings">
        <Button variant="outline" size="sm">
          <Settings className="h-4 w-4" />
          <span className="sr-only">Settings</span>
        </Button>
      </Link>
      <Button variant="ghost" size="sm" onClick={handleLogout}>
        <LogOut className="h-4 w-4" />
        Logout
      </Button>
    </div>
  </div>
</header>
```

### Navigation Consistency

All navigation links use the same pattern:
- Consistent styling with `Link` components
