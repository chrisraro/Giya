# Build Error Fix Summary

```

Additionally, there are warnings about multiple modules with names that only differ in casing:
```
There are multiple modules with names that only differ in casing.
This can lead to unexpected behavior when compiling on a filesystem with other case-semantic.
```

## Root Cause
The issue is caused by case sensitivity conflicts in the file system. There are multiple directories with similar names but different casing:
- `Giya` (uppercase)
- `giya` (lowercase)

This causes the build process to find modules with the same names but different paths, leading to conflicts.

## Solution
1. Ensure consistent casing in all file and directory names
2. Remove any duplicate directories with different casing
3. Fix any imports that might be referencing files with incorrect casing

## Implementation
The fix involves:
1. Checking for and removing duplicate directories
2. Ensuring all imports use correct casing
3. Cleaning the build cache and rebuilding

## Files Checked
- `components/qr-scanner.tsx` - Uses Html5Qrcode import correctly
- No custom `_document.tsx` files exist in the project
- No incorrect Html imports found in application code

## Resolution Steps
1. Clean build cache
2. Ensure consistent directory naming
3. Rebuild the application
