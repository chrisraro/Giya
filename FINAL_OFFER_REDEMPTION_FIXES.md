# Final Offer Redemption Fixes

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Server Components Error
**Problem**: The business profile page was throwing a Server Components render error.
**Root Cause**: Improper handling of async params in the page component.
**Fix**: Simplified the params handling from `params instanceof Promise ? await params : params` to direct access `params.id`.

### 2. QR Code Generation
**Problem**: QR codes were being generated with simple predictable IDs.
**Root Cause**: The database triggers were using simple UUID concatenation which could cause conflicts.
**Fix**: Updated the database functions to use `gen_random_uuid()` for generating unique QR code data.

### 3. Redemption Flow
**Problem**: "Redeem Now" buttons were just showing toast notifications instead of displaying QR codes.
**Root Cause**: Missing implementation for QR code display in modal dialogs.
**Fix**: 
- Added modal dialogs in both customer discount and exclusive offers pages
- Implemented proper QR code display when "Redeem Now" is clicked
- Added error handling for missing QR code data

### 4. Public QR Code Exposure
**Problem**: QR codes were being displayed publicly on business profile pages.
**Root Cause**: QR codes were included in the business profile queries and UI.
**Fix**: 
- Removed QR code data from business profile page queries
- Removed QR code display sections from business profile UI
- Updated buttons to guide users to their dashboard pages
