# Google Maps Implementation Verification

## Current Implementation

The Google Maps integration has been implemented with the following components:

1. **GoogleMap Component** ([components/google-map.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/components/google-map.tsx)):
   - Converts various Google Maps URL formats to embed URLs
   - Uses the Google Maps Embed API with your API key
   - Provides graceful fallback when embedding fails
   - Handles different URL formats (place, search, directions, coordinates)

2. **Business Profile Page** ([app/business/[id]/page.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/app/business/%5Bid%5D/page.tsx)):
   - Passes the Google Maps API key from environment variables to the component
   - Displays the map in the business location section

## How to Verify Implementation is Working

### 1. Check Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyCLFedRGdjh58eWuuG3CCJi6Fa7x7SV-4I
```

### 2. Test the Google Maps Component

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to any business profile page that has a Google Maps link
3. Check the browser console for log messages from the GoogleMap component

### 3. Expected Behavior

#### With Valid API Key
- Google Maps should embed directly in the business profile page
- Interactive map with full Google Maps functionality
- No fallback UI displayed
- Console should show messages like:
  ```
  Processing Google Maps URL: {url: "...", apiKey: "AIzaSy..."}
  Generated embed URL with coordinates: https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSy...
  Processed URL for iframe: https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSy...
  Google Maps loaded successfully
  ```

#### Without API Key or With Invalid Key
- Fallback UI with address and "Open in Google Maps" button
- No console errors
- Graceful degradation of functionality

## Troubleshooting

### If Maps Still Don't Display

1. **Check browser console** for any error messages
2. **Verify API key** is correctly set in `.env` file
3. **Check that the Google Maps URL** in the business record is valid
4. **Ensure the Google Maps Embed API** is enabled in your Google Cloud Console

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Restrictions**: Make sure your API key allows requests from localhost
2. **Billing**: Ensure billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project
3. **URL Format**: Some Google Maps URLs may not be convertible - these will show the fallback UI

## Testing Different URL Formats

The component handles these URL formats:
- Place URLs: `https://www.google.com/maps/place/...`
- Search URLs: `https://www.google.com/maps/search/...`
- Direction URLs: `https://www.google.com/maps/dir/...`
- Coordinate URLs: `https://www.google.com/maps/@...`

All of these should be properly converted to embed URLs when a valid API key is provided.
