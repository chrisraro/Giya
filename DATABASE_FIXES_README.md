# Database Schema Fixes for Giya Loyalty App

This document explains the issues that were identified and fixed in the Giya loyalty app related to the rewards and redemptions functionality.

## Issues Identified

1. **Column Name Mismatch**: The database schema had inconsistent column names between the `rewards` table and the application queries.
2. **Schema Inconsistency**: The `redemptions` table was missing several required columns and relationships.
3. **Data Migration Issues**: Existing redemption records were missing critical data like `business_id` and `points_redeemed`.
4. **Query Syntax Errors**: Some queries had incorrect syntax when aliasing columns.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Schema Fixes (`019_fix_database_schema_consistency.sql`)

- Ensured the `rewards` table uses `reward_name` instead of `name`
- Added all missing columns to the `redemptions` table:
  - `reward_id` (foreign key to rewards)
  - `points_redeemed` (integer)
  - `redemption_qr_code` (unique text)
  - `validated_at` (timestamp)
  - `validated_by` (foreign key to businesses)
  - `customer_id` (foreign key to customers)
  - `business_id` (foreign key to businesses)
- Created proper indexes for performance
- Updated RLS policies for proper access control
- Fixed database functions and triggers for point deduction

### 2. Data Migration (`020_migrate_existing_redemption_data.sql`)

- Updated existing redemptions to set `customer_id` from `user_id`
- Populated missing `business_id` from associated rewards
- Set `points_redeemed` from reward requirements
- Generated QR codes for redemptions that didn't have them
- Ensured all redemptions have a proper status

### 3. Frontend Code Fixes

- Fixed query syntax in business validation page
- Added fallback queries to handle both old and new column names
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added null checking throughout the UI components
- Enhanced debugging logs for troubleshooting

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. Run the database migration scripts in order:
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL editor
   \i scripts/019_fix_database_schema_consistency.sql
   \i scripts/020_migrate_existing_redemption_data.sql
   ```

2. Restart the application server

3. Test the following functionality:
   - Viewing available rewards
   - Redeeming rewards
   - Scanning redemption QR codes
   - Validating redemptions as a business

## Verification

After applying the fixes, you should be able to:

1. See all available rewards on the customer rewards page
2. Successfully redeem rewards with proper point deduction
3. Generate valid QR codes for redemptions
4. Scan and validate redemptions as a business
5. Handle edge cases like missing data gracefully

## Additional Notes

- The fixes include backward compatibility for older database schemas
- All queries now handle both `name` and `reward_name` columns
- Enhanced error messages provide better feedback to users
- Improved null checking prevents crashes from missing data
