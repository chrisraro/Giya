## Implementation Details

### Default First Visit Discount
During business setup, a default "First Visit Discount" (10% off) is automatically created for each business.

### Automatic Discount Application
When a business creates a transaction for a customer:
1. The system checks if the customer is visiting for the first time
2. It finds all applicable active discounts for that business
3. It filters out discounts the customer has already used
4. It applies the best available discount (highest value)
5. It records the discount usage

### Discount Types
1. **Percentage** - A percentage off the total purchase amount
2. **Fixed Amount** - A fixed peso amount off the total purchase
3. **First Visit Only** - Special discounts only for first-time customers

## UI Components

### Business Dashboard
- New "Discounts" section in navigation
- "Manage Discounts" button on the main dashboard
- Discount management page with CRUD operations

### Customer Dashboard
- "View Discounts" button in quick actions
- Discount browsing page showing all available offers

## API Functions
