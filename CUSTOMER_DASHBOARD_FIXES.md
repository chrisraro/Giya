# Customer Dashboard Issues and Fixes

## Overview

This document describes the issues identified with the customer dashboard and the fixes implemented to resolve them. The main problems were inaccurate points display and missing redemption history.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Inaccurate Points Display
- Customer total_points field was not being updated correctly
- Discrepancies between earned points and redeemed points
- Missing business_id in some redemption records

### 2. Missing Redemption History
- Redemption records were not being properly fetched due to:
  - Use of both customer_id and user_id fields in different tables
  - Missing business information in redemption records
  - Improper handling of different redemption types (rewards, discounts, exclusive offers)

### 3. Data Structure Inconsistencies
- Original redemptions table used user_id while newer tables (discount_usage, exclusive_offer_usage) used customer_id
- Missing business_id in redemption records
- Incomplete status information for redemptions

## Root Causes

### 1. Database Schema Evolution
- The original redemptions table was created with user_id field
- Newer tables (discount_usage, exclusive_offer_usage) were created with customer_id field
- Migration scripts were not properly updating all references

### 2. Data Migration Issues
- Some redemption records had user_id but missing customer_id
- Some records had missing business_id information
- Points calculation was not accounting for all redemption types correctly

### 3. Query Logic Problems
- Customer dashboard was not properly querying all redemption types
- Business information was not being properly linked to redemption records
- Date sorting was not working correctly across different redemption types

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Fixes ([scripts/fix_customer_dashboard_issues.sql](file://c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/scripts/fix_customer_dashboard_issues.sql))

#### Data Migration
- Updated redemptions table to populate customer_id from user_id where missing
- Fixed business_id in redemptions by getting it from the reward
- Fixed business_id in discount_usage and exclusive_offer_usage tables
- Ensured all redemptions have proper status values

#### Points Calculation
- Recalculated total_points for all customers based on:
  - Points earned from transactions
  - Points redeemed from reward redemptions (only rewards affect points, not discounts or exclusive offers)
- Created a function to ensure future consistency

### 2. Dashboard Data Hook ([hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts](file://c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts))

#### Improved Redemption Queries
- Query all three types of redemptions:
  - Rewards from redemptions table
  - Discounts from discount_usage table
  - Exclusive offers from exclusive_offer_usage table
- Properly handle both customer_id and user_id fields
- Fetch business information for all redemption types

#### Enhanced Data Processing
- Process each redemption type with appropriate business information
- Handle cases where business_id is stored in different locations
- Properly format redemption data for display

### 3. Component Updates

#### Customer Transaction History ([components/dashboard/customer-transaction-history.tsx](file://c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/components/dashboard/customer-transaction-history.tsx))
- Ensure all redemptions are properly passed to the component
- Debug logging to verify data flow

#### Redemption Item ([components/dashboard/redemption-item.tsx](file://c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/components/dashboard/redemption-item.tsx))
- Handle all three redemption types (reward, discount, exclusive)
- Properly display business information
- Correctly format points display for different redemption types

## Important Note About Points Calculation

It's important to understand that only reward redemptions affect a customer's total points. Discount offers and exclusive offers are separate redemption types that do not deduct points from a customer's balance. This is because:

1. Rewards require points to be redeemed
2. Discount offers and exclusive offers are typically redeemed through QR codes and don't require point deduction
3. Points are earned through transactions and spent on rewards only

## Files Modified

1. [hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts](file://c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts) - Updated redemption fetching logic
2. [scripts/fix_customer_dashboard_issues.sql](file://c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/scripts/fix_customer_dashboard_issues.sql) - Created database fix script
3. [scripts/diagnose_customer_dashboard_issues.sql](file://c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/scripts/diagnose_customer_dashboard_issues.sql) - Created diagnostic script

## Testing

To verify the fixes:

1. Run the diagnostic script to check current state:
   ```sql
   -- Replace CUSTOMER_ID with actual customer ID
   \i scripts/diagnose_customer_dashboard_issues.sql
   ```

2. Run the fix script to resolve issues:
   ```sql
   \i scripts/fix_customer_dashboard_issues.sql
   ```

3. Check the customer dashboard to verify:
   - Points are displayed correctly
   - All redemption history is shown
   - Different redemption types are properly displayed

## Future Improvements

1. Add automated consistency checks to run periodically
2. Implement real-time updates for points and redemptions
3. Add more detailed logging for debugging purposes
4. Create admin tools for manual data correction when needed

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Ensure all database schema changes include proper migration scripts
2. Maintain consistency in field naming across related tables
3. Implement comprehensive testing for data integrity
4. Document schema evolution and migration processes
