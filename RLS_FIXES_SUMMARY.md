# RLS Fixes Summary for Discount and Exclusive Offers Tables

## Overview
This document summarizes the work done to implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies for the newly added discount and exclusive offers tables.

## Files Created

### 1. RLS Policies Script
**File**: [scripts/029_enable_rls_for_discount_and_exclusive_offers.sql](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/scripts/029_enable_rls_for_discount_and_exclusive_offers.sql)
- Enabled RLS on all four new tables:
  - `discount_offers`
  - `discount_usage`
  - `exclusive_offers`
  - `exclusive_offer_usage`
- Implemented appropriate policies for each user role:
  - Businesses can view/create/update/delete their own offers
  - Customers can view active offers from businesses they've interacted with
  - Public can view active offers
  - System can insert usage records

### 2. RLS Verification Functions
**File**: [scripts/030_create_rls_verification_functions.sql](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/scripts/030_create_rls_verification_functions.sql)
- Created helper functions to verify RLS policies:
  - `check_rls_status(table_name)` - Check if RLS is enabled for a table
  - `get_policies_for_table(table_name)` - Get all policies for a table

### 3. RLS Verification Script
**File**: [check_rls_policies_extended.js](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/check_rls_policies_extended.js)
- Extended version of the RLS verification script
- Checks RLS status for all tables including the new ones
- Lists policies for each table

### 4. RLS Documentation
**File**: [RLS_POLICIES_FOR_NEW_TABLES.md](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/RLS_POLICIES_FOR_NEW_TABLES.md)
- Comprehensive documentation of all RLS policies for the new tables
- Detailed explanation of each policy and its purpose
- Implementation and verification instructions

## Tables Updated

### 1. discount_offers
- 6 policies implemented:
  - Business access control (view/create/update/delete)
  - Customer access to relevant offers
  - Public access to active offers

### 2. discount_usage
- 3 policies implemented:
  - Customer access to their usage history
  - Business access to usage of their offers
  - System access for recording usage

### 3. exclusive_offers
- 6 policies implemented:
  - Business access control (view/create/update/delete)
  - Customer access to relevant offers
  - Public access to active offers

### 4. exclusive_offer_usage
- 3 policies implemented:
  - Customer access to their usage history
  - Business access to usage of their offers
  - System access for recording usage

## Policy Details

### Business Access
- Businesses can only view, create, update, and delete their own offers
- Businesses can view usage statistics for their own offers
- Policies use `business_id in (select id from public.businesses where id = auth.uid())` to enforce access control

### Customer Access
- Customers can view their own usage history
- Customers can view active offers from businesses they've interacted with
- Policies use transaction history to determine relevant businesses
- Active offers are filtered by date and is_active status

### Public Access
- Anyone can view active offers (subject to date and active status filters)
- This allows for public browsing of available offers

### System Access
- System can insert usage records without restriction
- This enables automatic tracking of offer usage

## Verification

### Automated Verification
- Run [check_rls_policies_extended.js](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/check_rls_policies_extended.js) to verify all policies
- Script checks RLS status and lists policies for all tables

### Manual Verification
- Check that businesses can only see their own offers
- Check that customers can see offers from businesses they've interacted with
- Check that inactive/expired offers are not visible
- Check that usage tracking works correctly

## Integration with Existing System

### Consistency
- Policies follow the same patterns as existing RLS policies
- Same authentication mechanisms (auth.uid())
- Same access control principles

### Security
- Data isolation maintained between user roles
- No unauthorized access to sensitive data
- Public access limited to appropriate information only

## Deployment Instructions

1. Run [scripts/029_enable_rls_for_discount_and_exclusive_offers.sql](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/scripts/029_enable_rls_for_discount_and_exclusive_offers.sql) in Supabase SQL editor
2. Optionally run [scripts/030_create_rls_verification_functions.sql](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/scripts/030_create_rls_verification_functions.sql)
3. Update [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) and [TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md) to reference the new files
4. Verify deployment with [check_rls_policies_extended.js](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/check_rls_policies_extended.js)

## Future Considerations

1. Regular verification of RLS policies
2. Monitoring of policy effectiveness
3. Potential refinement of access controls based on user feedback
4. Extension of policies to new features as they are added
