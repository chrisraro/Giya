# Google Maps Integration Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem Analysis

The error you're seeing:
```
Refused to display 'https://www.google.com/' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'sameorigin'.
```

This is a security measure implemented by Google to prevent their main website from being embedded in iframes. This is intentional and cannot be bypassed.

## Root Causes

1. **X-Frame-Options Header**: Google sets `X-Frame-Options: sameorigin` on their main website, which prevents embedding
2. **Incorrect URL Format**: Using standard Google Maps URLs instead of proper Embed API URLs
3. **Missing API Key**: Google Maps Embed API requires an API key for most features

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created a Dedicated GoogleMap Component

The new [GoogleMap component](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/components/google-map.tsx) provides:
- Proper URL conversion for different Google Maps URL formats
- Graceful fallback when embedding fails
- Better error handling and user experience

### 2. Fallback Strategy

When Google Maps embedding fails (which is expected for most URLs):
- Display a user-friendly fallback with the address
- Provide a button to open the map in a new tab
- Maintain consistent UI design

### 3. URL Conversion Logic

The component handles these URL formats:
- Place URLs: `https://www.google.com/maps/place/...`
- Search URLs: `https://www.google.com/maps/search/...`
- Direction URLs: `https://www.google.com/maps/dir/...`
- Coordinate URLs: `https://www.google.com/maps/@...`

## How to Fix Permanently

### Option 1: Use Google Maps Embed API (Recommended)

1. **Get a Google Cloud API Key**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable the Maps Embed API
   - Create an API key
   - Restrict the API key to your domain

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   Add to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Update the GoogleMap Component**:
   Modify [components/google-map.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/components/google-map.tsx) to use the API key:
   ```typescript
   // In the URL conversion functions, replace:
   return `https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=&q=${lat},${lng}&zoom=15`
   
   // With:
   return `https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}&q=${lat},${lng}&zoom=15`
   ```

### Option 2: Continue Using Fallback (Current Implementation)

The current implementation will:
- Attempt to embed Google Maps
- Gracefully fall back to a static display with address and link
- Provide good user experience even when embedding fails

## Testing the Fix

### Test Cases

1. **Valid Google Maps URLs**:
   - Place URLs with coordinates
   - Place URLs with names
   - Search URLs
   - Direction URLs

2. **Invalid URLs**:
   - Malformed URLs
   - Non-Google URLs
   - Empty URLs

3. **Fallback Behavior**:
   - Verify fallback displays correctly
   - Check that "Open in Google Maps" button works
   - Ensure address is displayed when available

### Expected Results

- All Google Maps URLs should show the fallback instead of a blank iframe
- Users should be able to click "Open in Google Maps" to view the location
- No console errors related to X-Frame-Options
- Consistent UI experience across all browsers

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Always Use Embed API**: For production applications, use the official Google Maps Embed API with a valid API key
2. **Implement Fallbacks**: Always provide fallback content for iframe failures
3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Use onError handlers to detect and respond to embedding failures
4. **Test Across Browsers**: Different browsers may handle X-Frame-Options differently
5. **Document Limitations**: Clearly document to users that some maps may not embed due to security restrictions

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Map Shows Blank or Loading Forever
**Solution**: This is expected behavior due to X-Frame-Options. The fallback will be displayed instead.

### Issue: "Open in Google Maps" Button Not Working
**Solution**: Verify the URL is correctly passed to the component and check browser console for errors.

### Issue: Address Not Displaying in Fallback
**Solution**: Ensure the address prop is passed to the GoogleMap component.

## Security Considerations

1. **X-Frame-Options**: This is a security feature that should not be bypassed
2. **API Keys**: If using Google Maps Embed API, properly restrict API keys to your domains
3. **User Privacy**: Opening links in new tabs maintains user context and security

## Performance Impact

The fallback solution:
- Reduces unnecessary network requests for iframe content that will fail
- Provides immediate feedback to users
- Maintains consistent page load performance
