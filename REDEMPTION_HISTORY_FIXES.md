# Redemption History Fixes

## Overview

This document describes the issues identified with the redemption history display and the fixes implemented to resolve them. The main problem was that only exclusive offer redemptions were being displayed, while reward and discount redemptions were missing due to query errors.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Query Relationship Ambiguity
- The reward redemptions query was failing with error "PGRST201: Could not embed because more than one relationship was found for 'redemptions' and 'businesses'"
- This occurred because the redemptions table has multiple foreign key relationships to the businesses table:
  - `business_id` (the business associated with the reward)
  - `validated_by` (the business that validated the redemption)

### 2. Incomplete Redemption Display
- Only exclusive offer redemptions were being displayed
- Reward and discount redemptions were missing due to query failures
- Customers couldn't see their complete redemption history

### 3. Data Fetching Issues
- The dashboard data hook wasn't properly handling query errors
- Business dashboard queries had similar potential issues

## Root Causes

### 1. Foreign Key Relationship Ambiguity
- The redemptions table has multiple foreign keys pointing to the businesses table
- When querying with embedded relationships, PostgREST couldn't determine which foreign key to use
- This caused query failures and missing data

### 2. Incomplete Error Handling
- Query errors weren't being properly handled in the dashboard data hook
- Failed queries for one redemption type affected the display of others

### 3. Schema Evolution
- As the database schema evolved with new redemption types, queries weren't updated to handle the complexity

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Query Relationships ([hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts](file://c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts))

#### Reward Redemptions Query
Fixed the ambiguous relationship by specifying the exact foreign key:
```typescript
businesses!redemptions_business_id_fkey (
  business_name,
  profile_pic_url
)
```

#### Discount and Exclusive Offer Queries
Ensured proper relationship handling for newer redemption types:
```typescript
businesses (
  business_name,
  profile_pic_url
)
```

### 2. Improved Error Handling
Enhanced error handling to prevent one failed query from affecting others:
```typescript
// Handle errors properly
if (rewardRedemptionsError) {
  console.error("[v0] Reward redemptions query error:", rewardRedemptionsError);
}

if (discountRedemptionsError) {
  console.error("[v0] Discount redemptions query error:", discountRedemptionsError);
}

if (exclusiveOfferRedemptionsError) {
  console.error("[v0] Exclusive offer redemptions query error:", exclusiveOfferRedemptionsError);
}
```

### 3. Business Dashboard Queries ([hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts](file://c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts))
Fixed similar potential issues in business dashboard queries:
```typescript
// Simplified query without ambiguous relationships
const { data: redemptionValidations, error: redemptionValidationsError } = await supabase
  .from("redemptions")
  .select(
    `
    id,
    customer_id,
    reward_id,
    points_redeemed,
    validated_at,
    status,
    customers (
      full_name,
      profile_pic_url
    ),
    rewards (
      reward_name
    )
  `,
  )
  .eq("business_id", userId)
  .eq("status", "validated")
  .order("validated_at", { ascending: false })
  .limit(20);
```

## Files Modified

1. [hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts](file://c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts) - Fixed query relationships and error handling
2. [components/dashboard/customer-transaction-history.tsx](file://c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/components/dashboard/customer-transaction-history.tsx) - Verified component structure
3. [components/dashboard/redemption-item.tsx](file://c:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/components/dashboard/redemption-item.tsx) - Verified component handling of all redemption types

## Testing

To verify the fixes:

1. Check browser console for errors - should no longer see "PGRST201" errors
2. Verify that all redemption types are displayed in customer dashboard:
   - Reward redemptions
   - Discount redemptions
   - Exclusive offer redemptions
3. Confirm that business dashboard queries work correctly

## Future Improvements

1. Add automated testing for query relationships
2. Implement more robust error handling with user-friendly messages
3. Create admin tools for diagnosing query issues

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always specify foreign key relationships when querying tables with multiple foreign keys to the same table
2. Implement comprehensive error handling for data fetching
3. Document complex relationship structures
4. Test queries thoroughly when adding new table relationships
