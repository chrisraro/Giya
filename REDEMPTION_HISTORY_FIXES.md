# Redemption History Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made to address the issues with the "Your Business Points" section not displaying cards and the redemption history not showing all types of redemptions.

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Business Points Display**: The "Your Business Points" section was not showing any business points cards.
2. **Incomplete Redemption History**: The redemption history only showed reward redemptions and missed discount and exclusive offer redemptions.

## Root Causes

1. **Business Points Issue**: The `calculateBusinessPoints` function in the `useDashboardData` hook was not properly handling all business relationships, particularly for customers who had only redeemed offers but never made transactions.

2. **Redemption History Issue**: The application was only querying the `redemptions` table for reward redemptions, but discount and exclusive offer redemptions are stored in separate tables:
   - `redemptions` table for reward redemptions
   - `discount_usage` table for discount offer redemptions
   - `exclusive_offer_usage` table for exclusive offer redemptions

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced useDashboardData Hook

Updated the `fetchCustomerData` function to fetch all types of redemptions:

```typescript
// Fetch all types of redemptions
// 1. Reward redemptions
const { data: rewardRedemptions } = await supabase
  .from("redemptions")
  .select(/* reward redemption fields */)
  .eq("customer_id", userId)
  .order("redeemed_at", { ascending: false });

// 2. Discount redemptions
const { data: discountRedemptions } = await supabase
  .from("discount_usage")
  .select(/* discount redemption fields */)
  .eq("customer_id", userId)
  .order("used_at", { ascending: false });

// 3. Exclusive offer redemptions
const { data: exclusiveOfferRedemptions } = await supabase
  .from("exclusive_offer_usage")
  .select(/* exclusive offer redemption fields */)
  .eq("customer_id", userId)
  .order("used_at", { ascending: false });

// Combine all redemptions and sort by date
let allRedemptions: Redemption[] = [];

// Process each type with appropriate mapping
// ... (implementation details)
```

### 2. Updated Redemption Interface

Enhanced the `Redemption` interface to support all three types of redemptions:

```typescript
export interface Redemption {
  id: string;
  redeemed_at: string;
  status: string;
  business_id: string | null;
  reward_id?: string;
  rewards?: {
    reward_name: string;
    points_required: number;
    image_url: string | null;
  };
  // For discount redemptions
  discount_offer_id?: string;
  discount_offers?: {
    offer_title: string;
    points_required: number;
    image_url: string | null;
  };
  // For exclusive offer redemptions
  exclusive_offer_id?: string;
  exclusive_offers?: {
    offer_title: string;
    points_required: number;
    image_url: string | null;
  };
  // Type field to distinguish between redemption types
  redemption_type?: 'reward' | 'discount' | 'exclusive';
}
```

### 3. Enhanced RedemptionItem Component

Updated the `RedemptionItem` component to properly display all three types of redemptions with appropriate icons and information:

```typescript
const getDisplayInfo = () => {
  switch (redemption.redemption_type) {
    case 'discount':
      return {
        name: redemption.discount_offers?.offer_title || 'Discount Offer',
        points: redemption.discount_offers?.points_required || 0,
        icon: Tag,
        image_url: redemption.discount_offers?.image_url
      };
    case 'exclusive':
      return {
        name: redemption.exclusive_offers?.offer_title || 'Exclusive Offer',
        points: redemption.exclusive_offers?.points_required || 0,
        icon: Star,
        image_url: redemption.exclusive_offers?.image_url
      };
    case 'reward':
    default:
      return {
        name: redemption.rewards?.reward_name || 'Reward',
        points: redemption.rewards?.points_required || 0,
        icon: Gift,
        image_url: redemption.rewards?.image_url
      };
  }
};
```

### 4. Improved Business Points Calculation

Enhanced the `calculateBusinessPoints` function to properly account for all business relationships:

```typescript
// Get all businesses the customer has transacted with
const { data: businessTransactions } = await supabase
  .from("points_transactions")
  .select(`
    business_id,
    businesses (
      business_name,
      profile_pic_url
    )
  `)
  .eq("customer_id", customerId)
  .order("transaction_date", { ascending: false });

// Also get businesses where customer has redemptions but no transactions
const { data: redemptionBusinesses } = await supabase
  .from("redemptions")
  .select(`
    business_id,
    businesses (
      business_name,
      profile_pic_url
    )
  `)
  .eq("customer_id", customerId)
  .order("redeemed_at", { ascending: false });
```

## Results

1. **Business Points Display**: The "Your Business Points" section now correctly displays business points cards for all businesses where the customer has either made transactions or redemptions.

2. **Unified Redemption History**: The redemption history now shows a unified view of all redemptions:
   - Reward redemptions
   - Discount offer redemptions
   - Exclusive offer redemptions

3. **Better User Experience**: Users can now see all their redemption activities in one place, sorted by date with clear indicators of the redemption type.

## Testing

The application has been tested to ensure:
- Business points are correctly calculated and displayed
- All types of redemptions appear in the history
- Redemptions are sorted by date (most recent first)
- Proper icons and labels are shown for each redemption type
- Business information is correctly associated with each redemption

## Future Improvements

1. Add pagination for redemption history to handle large numbers of redemptions
2. Implement filtering options to view specific types of redemptions
3. Add export functionality for redemption history
4. Enhance error handling for cases where business data might be missing
