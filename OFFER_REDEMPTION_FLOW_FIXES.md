# Offer Redemption Flow Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Server Components Error**: The business profile page was experiencing a Server Components render error due to improper handling of async params and potential issues with dynamic imports.

2. **QR Code Display Issue**: QR codes for discount and exclusive offers were being displayed directly on the business profile page, but they should only be accessible when users click "Redeem Now" on their respective dashboard pages.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Business Profile Page (`app/business/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Fixed the Server Components error by:
  - Simplifying the params handling (removed Promise handling that was causing issues)
  - Removed QR code data from the select queries for discount and exclusive offers
  - Updated the "View Details" buttons to inform users they need to visit their dashboard pages
- Removed QR code display sections from both discount and exclusive offers cards
- Maintained the same UI structure but without the QR code sections

### 2. Customer Discounts Page (`app/dashboard/customer/discounts/page.tsx`)
- Implemented a proper QR code redemption flow:
  - Removed the static QR code display from the offer cards
  - Added a modal dialog that shows the QR code when "Redeem Now" is clicked
  - Added proper error handling for missing QR code data
  - Improved the user experience with clear instructions

### 3. Customer Exclusive Offers Page (`app/dashboard/customer/exclusive-offers/page.tsx`)
- Implemented the same QR code redemption flow as the discounts page:
  - Removed the static QR code display from the offer cards
  - Added a modal dialog that shows the QR code when "Redeem Now" is clicked
  - Added proper error handling for missing QR code data
  - Improved the user experience with clear instructions

## Technical Changes

### Business Profile Page Changes
- Simplified params handling from `params instanceof Promise ? await params : params` to direct access
- Removed `qr_code_data` from select queries for both discount_offers and exclusive_offers
- Removed QR code display sections from the UI
- Updated button text and toast messages to guide users to the correct pages

### Customer Dashboard Pages Changes
- Added state management for QR code dialog (`showQRDialog`, `selectedDiscount`/`selectedOffer`)
- Added `QrCode` icon to the "Redeem Now" buttons
- Created modal dialogs for QR code display with proper styling
- Added error handling for missing QR code data
- Improved user instructions in the dialogs

## Benefits

1. **Fixed Server Components Error**: The business profile page now loads correctly without the render error.
2. **Improved Security**: QR codes are no longer publicly visible on business profiles.
3. **Better User Experience**: Users now have a clear redemption flow through their dashboard.
4. **Consistent Design**: Both discount and exclusive offers now follow the same redemption pattern.
5. **Clear Instructions**: Users are guided to the correct pages for offer redemption.

## Testing

To test these fixes:
1. Visit a business profile page - verify no QR codes are displayed and no Server Components error occurs
2. Go to the customer dashboard discounts page - click "Redeem Now" to see the QR code modal
3. Go to the customer dashboard exclusive offers page - click "Redeem Now" to see the QR code modal
4. Verify that the QR codes are only accessible through the redemption flow

## Future Improvements

1. Add analytics tracking for offer redemptions
2. Implement expiration checking for QR codes
3. Add business-side validation UI for scanning these QR codes
4. Consider adding offline access for QR codes
