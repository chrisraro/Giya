# Production Issue Fixes for Reward Redemption Flow

## Overview
This document details the issues identified in the production environment and the fixes implemented to resolve them.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Database Schema Issues
- **Missing RLS Policy Condition**: Script 008 was missing the `auth.uid() = user_id` condition in the SELECT policy, causing existing records to be inaccessible
- **Missing Field in Query**: Business validation page was checking `business_id` but not selecting it in the query

### 2. Data Migration Issues
- **Incomplete Data Migration**: Some existing redemption records had [user_id](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/scripts/001_create_tables.sql#L97-L97) populated but [customer_id](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/scripts/007_update_redemptions_table.sql#L3-L3) as null

### 3. Frontend Issues
- **Missing Navigation**: Business users had no clear way to access the redemption validation page
- **Poor Feedback**: Missing or inadequate toast notifications for successful redemptions
- **Incomplete History**: Customer dashboard didn't properly display redemption history with business information

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Fixes

#### Updated RLS Policies (scripts/008_fix_redemptions_schema.sql)
```sql
create policy "Users can view their own redemptions"
  on public.redemptions for select
  using (
    auth.uid() = customer_id or 
    auth.uid() = business_id or
    auth.uid() = validated_by or
    auth.uid() = user_id
  );

create policy "Customers can create redemptions"
  on public.redemptions for insert
  with check (auth.uid() = customer_id or auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Businesses can update redemptions"
  on public.redemptions for update
  using (auth.uid() = business_id or auth.uid() = validated_by);
```

#### Data Migration Script (scripts/018_fix_redemption_user_data.sql)
```sql
-- Fix existing redemption records that have user_id but missing customer_id
update public.redemptions 
set customer_id = user_id
where customer_id is null and user_id is not null;
```

### 2. Frontend Fixes

#### Business Dashboard Navigation ([app/dashboard/business/page.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/app/dashboard/business/page.tsx))
Added a prominent "Validate Redemptions" button for easier access to the validation page.

#### Business Validation Page Query ([app/dashboard/business/validate-redemption/page.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/app/dashboard/business/validate-redemption/page.tsx))
Fixed the query to include the [business_id](file:///c%3A/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/giya/scripts/007_update_redemptions_table.sql#L4-L4) field:
```typescript
const { data: redemption, error: redemptionError } = await supabase
  .from("redemptions")
  .select(
    `
    id,
    customer_id,
    reward_id,
    points_redeemed,
    status,
    validated_at,
    business_id,  -- Added this missing field
    customers (
      full_name,
      profile_pic_url
    ),
    rewards (
      name as reward_name,
      description,
      points_required
    )
  `,
  )
  .eq("redemption_qr_code", qrCode)
  .single()
```

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Apply Database Migrations
Run the following scripts in order on your Supabase production database:

1. **Apply the updated script 008**:
   ```sql
   -- Run the updated 008_fix_redemptions_schema.sql
   ```

2. **Apply the data migration script**:
   ```sql
   -- Run 018_fix_redemption_user_data.sql
   ```

### 2. Deploy Frontend Changes
Deploy the updated frontend code to your production environment (Vercel).

### 3. Verify Fixes
1. Test the business dashboard navigation to ensure the "Validate Redemptions" button works
2. Test the complete redemption flow:
   - Customer redeems a reward
   - Business validates the redemption
   - Verify proper toast notifications appear
   - Check that redemption history displays correctly in the customer dashboard

## Rollback Plan
If issues are discovered after deployment:

1. Revert the database schema changes by restoring the previous RLS policies
2. Revert the frontend code to the previous version
3. Contact the development team for further assistance

## Monitoring
After deployment, monitor:
1. Supabase logs for any RLS policy violations
2. Frontend error logs for any JavaScript errors
3. User feedback for any remaining issues
