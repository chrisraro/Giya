# Customer Dashboard Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the customer dashboard to fix the total points calculation and add the business points module.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Total Points Calculation**: The [total_points](file:///c:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\giya\scripts\001_create_tables.sql#L15-L15) field in the customers table was not being updated correctly in some cases.
2. **Business Points Module**: Added a new tab to display points per business with available rewards.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Total Points Calculation Fix (`scripts/021_fix_total_points_calculation_simple.sql`)

- Created a script to recalculate and update the [total_points](file:///c:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\giya\scripts\001_create_tables.sql#L15-L15) field for all customers
- The script compares the stored [total_points](file:///c:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\giya\scripts\001_create_tables.sql#L15-L15) with a calculated value based on:
  - Sum of points earned from transactions
  - Minus sum of points redeemed
- Updates any discrepancies to ensure data consistency

### 2. Business Points Module (`app/dashboard/customer/page.tsx`)

Added a new "Business Points" tab with the following features:

- **Card-based Display**: Shows businesses the customer has interacted with in a grid layout
- **Points Balance**: Displays current points balance for each business
- **Available Rewards**: Shows how many rewards are available at each business
- **Navigation**: Clicking a business card navigates to the business profile page
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both mobile (swipeable cards) and desktop (grid layout)

### 3. Enhanced Data Fetching

- Added new state variable `businessPoints` to store business points data
- Implemented logic to calculate points per business by:
  - Getting all transactions per business
  - Subtracting all redemptions per business
  - Counting available rewards per business
- Added proper error handling and logging

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. Run the database script to fix total points calculation:
   ```sql
   \i scripts/021_fix_total_points_calculation_simple.sql
   ```

2. The frontend changes are already implemented in the customer dashboard component

3. Test the dashboard to ensure:
   - Total points display correctly
   - Business points tab shows data
   - Clicking business cards navigates to business profiles

## Verification

After applying the fixes, verify that:

1. Customer total points are calculated correctly
2. Business points tab displays accurate information
3. Available rewards count is correct per business
4. Navigation to business profiles works correctly
5. No errors appear in the browser console

## Additional Notes

- The business points calculation is done in real-time when the dashboard loads
- The UI is responsive and works on both mobile and desktop
- All data fetching includes proper error handling
- The solution maintains backward compatibility with existing code
