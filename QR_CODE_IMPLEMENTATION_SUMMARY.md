## Implementation Details

### QR Code Generation
QR codes are automatically generated when new discount or exclusive offers are created using database triggers:
- Format: `GIYA-DISCOUNT-{offer_id}` for discount offers
- Format: `GIYA-EXCLUSIVE-{offer_id}` for exclusive offers

### Centralized QR Scanning
The business dashboard now uses a single QR scanner that can process multiple types of QR codes:
1. Customer QR codes for awarding points
2. Reward redemption QR codes for validating rewards
3. Discount offer QR codes for applying discounts
4. Exclusive offer QR codes for redeeming exclusive offers

### User Experience
- Businesses can scan any type of QR code from the main dashboard
- Customers can view and show QR codes for all their available offers
- All QR codes are displayed with clear instructions for use

## Deployment Instructions

1. Run the database scripts in order:
   - `scripts/031_add_qr_code_columns_to_offers.sql`
   - `scripts/032_create_offer_redemption_functions.sql`

2. Deploy the updated frontend code

3. Verify that:
   - New discount and exclusive offers automatically generate QR codes
   - The business dashboard QR scanner can process all types of QR codes
   - Customers can view QR codes for their offers
   - The Validate Redemptions page has been removed

## Testing

### Business Side
1. Create a new discount offer and verify QR code is generated
2. Create a new exclusive offer and verify QR code is generated
3. Open QR scanner and scan:
   - Customer QR codes (should prompt for transaction amount)
   - Reward redemption QR codes (should show validation dialog)
   - Discount offer QR codes (should apply discount)
   - Exclusive offer QR codes (should redeem offer)

### Customer Side
1. Browse discount offers and verify QR codes are displayed
2. Browse exclusive offers and verify QR codes are displayed
3. Show QR codes to businesses for redemption

## Security Considerations

- QR codes are unique per offer and cannot be reused
- Database functions validate business ownership before applying redemptions
- Usage limits are enforced at the database level
- First visit only discounts are validated against customer transaction history

## Future Enhancements

1. Add QR code expiration dates for additional security
2. Implement QR code analytics to track usage patterns
3. Add bulk QR code generation for marketing campaigns
4. Implement QR code customization options (colors, logos)
